## Loan Performance and Investor Return Analysis (Tchnocolabs Softwares Internship)

This repository is dedicated to analyzing loan performance, borrower characteristics, and investor returns within the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending market. The project combines advanced data processing techniques, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations to uncover insights for improving loan portfolio performance.

## Project Overview

P2P lending platforms enable direct transactions between borrowers and lenders, bypassing traditional financial institutions. This project evaluates:
- Loan performance across various borrower profiles.
- Factors influencing investor returns.
- Risk assessment strategies to minimize defaults and optimize yields.

## Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
   - Transformation of key date-related columns to a standardized format.
   - Handling missing values through mode and median imputation.
   - Outlier detection using the IQR method for financial variables like APR and credit scores.

2. **Data Encoding**
   - Binary encoding of `LoanStatus` for better analysis of default trends.
   - Addition of derived metrics like `Default Rate` for portfolio health assessment.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualization of borrower characteristics such as credit grades and Prosper ratings.
   - Analysis of trends in delinquency rates, default risks, and lender yields.

4. **Dashboard Insights**
   - Interactive dashboards in Power BI provide a dynamic view of:
     - Loan distribution across statuses.
     - Trends in borrower risk and investor returns.
     - Performance across credit grades and loan terms.
